# Ackis' AutoHotkey Scripts
This repository is a compilation of various scripts written/obtained for use with [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

## Clicker Games

I believe I wrote these scripts on my own, with the assistance of forums/tutorials/irc/etc  - they weren't copy/pasted.

Automatic mouse clicker script with three different speeds.  This sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.  I don't know why it doesn't.

*USE AT YOUR OWN RISK*

Press F8 to start/stop the script.

Press the shift key to stop everything - incase something goes wrong.  Kind of an emergency exit.

F10 - Fast clicking
F11 - Medium clicking
F12 - Slow clicking

### Keyboardslow

Dumbed down version of the above script.

F12 - Start

## Make it Rain

Automatic clicker for the game Make it Rain.  Don't use this.

## Taptiles

Copy/pasted from a forum.
