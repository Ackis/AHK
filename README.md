# Ackis' AutoHotkey Scripts
This repository is a compilation of various scripts written/obtained for use with [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

## Clicker Games

I believe I wrote these scripts on my own, with the assistance of forums/tutorials/irc/etc  - they weren't copy/pasted.

Automatic mouse clicker script with three different speeds.  This sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.  I don't know why it doesn't.

*USE AT YOUR OWN RISK*

Press F8 to start/stop the script.

Press the shift key to stop everything - incase something goes wrong.  Kind of an emergency exit.

F10 - Fast clicking
F11 - Medium clicking
F12 - Slow clicking
